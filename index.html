Working list
--------------------------
Using MemSet in OSlice
	- Now need to test the sliced output, see if the same as the previous (Set of CLPs) appraoch 
	- /mnt/A/wsept/otawa_v2/build/oslice vs /mnt/A/wsept/otawa_v2/build/oslice_orig
CLP:Investigation of Store at T address (which clear all the address entries)
	- conti example
	- PPC/ARM maladalen
	- otest
CLP:AND operation
	- find new delta for resulted CLP
CLP filtering: predicates or more blocks 
	- need math
	- check the paper
CLP: filter vs widening, which one goes first/after ?
OSIM report (v1 completed. working on v2....)
OSLICE in otawa 2

Questions
--------------------------
(1) Store to multiple address, i.e. store r2, [r3] where r3 = clp(b,d,m). If the range is under treshold - writes to all these addresses. Is this safe ?


Answers
--------------------------
(1) Store to multiple address, i.e. store r2, [r3] where r3 = clp(b,d,m). Should memory be wiped out or just clear the target addresses? If the range is over-threshold, clear the covered area.
