Questions
--------------------------
(1) Store to multiple address, i.e. store r2, [r3] where r3 = clp(b,d,m). If the range is under treshold - writes to all these addresses. Is this safe ?


Answers
--------------------------
(1) Store to multiple address, i.e. store r2, [r3] where r3 = clp(b,d,m). Should memory be wiped out or just clear the target addresses? If the range is over-threshold, clear the covered area.
